description: Know Your Worth: A Lesson in Self-Value

As professionals, we've all been there - feeling undervalued, overworked, and underappreciated. But what if I told you that your worth isn't defined by your job title, salary, or someone else's opinion? I want to share an inspirational perspective that has stayed with me. It's a story about a father's wisdom and the value of self-worth.

Before he died, a father said to his son:

“Here is a watch your grandfather gave me… It is almost 200 years old. Before I give it to you, go to the jewelry store in the city. Tell them that I want to sell it, and see how much they offer you.”

The son went to the jewelry store, came back to his father, and said; “They offered $100 because it is so old.”

The father said; “Well, try the pawnshop.”

The son went to the pawnshop, came back to his father, and said;

“The pawnshop offered only $20 because it has a scratch”

The father asked his son to go to the museum and show them the watch.
The son quietly questioned his father’s judgement, but still, willing to act on his last wishes he went to the museum, when he came back he said to his father; 

“The curator offered $375,000 for this very rare piece to be included in their precious antique collection.”

The father responded:

“I wanted to show you that the right place will value you in the right way. Don’t find yourself in the wrong place and get angry because you are not valued. Never stay in a place where someone doesn’t see your value or you don’t feel appreciated.”

As I reflect on this story, I'm reminded that in today's challenging job market, it's easy to lose sight of our worth. But I want to encourage you to hold on to hope. In the midst of uncertainty and doubt, remember that your worth isn't defined by your current circumstances. It's not a question of if, but when, your talents will be recognized, and your dreams will begin.

Here's a nice little poem for inspiration.

When the darkness fades, and the light shines through,
You'll emerge stronger, wiser, and more resilient than you knew.
So take a breath, dear heart, and know you're not alone,
Your worth is inherent, and your future is yet unknown.
We got this!
